# Retrieval-Augmented-Question-Answering-QA-System-using-FAISS-TAPAS
This project builds a RAG system on the Student Performance &amp; Behavior Dataset from Kaggle. It uses FAISS for vector search and TAPAS for tabular question answering. The pipeline retrieves relevant rows and generates mostly accurate answers, enabling natural language queries over structured student data.
